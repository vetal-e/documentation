# Workflows

In a business application, a `workflow` is a sequence of steps or rules applied to a process from its initiation to completion.
In Oro applications, workflows organize and direct usersâ€™ work, making them follow particular steps in a pre-defined order, or preventing them from performing actions that either contradict or conflict with the logical steps of a process.

A workflow `step` is a state of an entity record. It is represented by an instance of the `Oro\Bundle\WorkflowBundle\Entity\WorkflowStep` class.
The process of moving an entity from one step to another is called a `transition`.

This guide explains and illustrates how to create workflows through configuration files, and provides details on workflow components and their translation.
