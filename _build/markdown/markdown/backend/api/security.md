# Configure Stateless Security Firewalls

The Symfony framework allows for the creation of stateless firewalls. In this case, the security token is not serialized for a session.

However, when API calls are utilized in AJAX requests from the UI, the userâ€™s token data from the current session must be used instead of the firewall credentials. For this purpose, the firewall should have the <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/6.4/reference/configuration/security.html#firewall-context" target="_blank">context</a> parameter with the context name that the system can use to authenticate the user.

For example:

```yaml
security:
    firewalls:
        some_stateless_firewall_with_AJAX_requests:
            stateless: true
            context:   main
            # ...
```
