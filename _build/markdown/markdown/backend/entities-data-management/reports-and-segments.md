# Reports & Segments

## Reports

OroPlatform allows you to create customized reports about the entities in your
application. For example, you may want to create a report that displays the achieved accounts by opportunity
like this:

### Configure a Report

Building a new report is as easy as defining a data grid. A data grid is a YAML configuration living in a
file called `datagrids.yml` in your bundleâ€™s `Resources/config/oro` directory for the backend datagrid and in `Resources/views/layouts/<theme>/config/datagrids.yml` for the frontend datagrid. Take a look at the following example:

#### NOTE
src/Acme/Bundle/DemoBundle/Resources/config/oro/datagrids.yml
```yaml
datagrids:
    acme-demo-question-report:
        pageTitle: acme.demo.question.page_title
        source:
            type: orm
            acl_resource: oro_report_view
            query:
                select:
                    - SUM(o.id) as value
                    - COUNT(o.id) as total
                    - o.subject
                    - o.description
                groupBy: o.dueDate
                from:
                    - { table: Acme\Bundle\DemoBundle\Entity\Question, alias: o }
        properties:
            subject: ~
            description: ~
        totals:
            total:
                extends: grand_total
                per_page: true
                hide_if_one_page: true
                columns:
                    total:
                        label: acme.demo.question.total
            grand_total:
                columns:
                    total:
                        expr: COUNT( o.id )
                    value:
                        label: acme.demo.question.grand_total
                        expr: SUM( o.id )
                        formatter: number

        columns:
            subject: { label: acme.demo.question.subject.label }
            description: { label: acme.demo.question.description.label }
            total: { label: acme.demo.question.total, frontend_type: integer }
            value: { label: acme.demo.question.grand_total, frontend_type: number }
        sorters:
            columns:
                subject: { data_name: subject }
                description: { data_name: description }
                total: { data_name: total }
                value: { data_name: value }
        filters:
            columns:
                total:
                    type: number
                    data_name: total
                    filter_by_having: true
                value:
                    type: number
                    data_name: value
                    filter_by_having: true
                createdAt:
                    type: date
                    label: oro.ui.created_at
                    data_name: o.createdAt
        options:
            entityHint: report data
            export: true
```

The definition of a data grid consists of the following sections:

`pageTitle`

> The report headline, you can use labels for translations here.

`source`

> The `source` property describes which data need to be fetched from the database to collect all
> data needed for the report. As you can see, you can use all the features you
> already know from the Doctrine query builder. The `acl_resource` specifies the ACL a user has
> to fulfill to be able to access the data grid.

> #### SEE ALSO
> You can learn more about other data source types and how to implement your own adapter in
> the [datasource documentation](../entities/customize-datagrids/backend/datasources/index.md#customize-datagrids-datasource).

`totals`

> Here you configure which columns of the grid you want to display total values for the
> currently shown page (`total`) and for all existing entries (`grand_total`). You can also
> specify custom expressions that will be executed to calculate the actual value being shown
> (e.g., to display the total revenue, all existing values will be summed up.

`columns`

> The `columns` option configures which columns will be visible in the data grid. As you can
> see, you can either refer to values that are produced by the `source` (like `cnt` or
> `value`) or to a kind of *virtual column* (like `period`), which can be defined through custom
> `filters` (see below).

`sorters`

> This option configures which columns can be used to sort entries by the time they are displayed.
> You can refer to the `columns` that you defined before.

`filters`

> The `filters` option allows you to provide the user interface to filter the report to display only a subset of all available entries. In the example above, the `period` column, used in other options before, lets the user select from a list for which period entries should be shown. The available choices directly refer to the fields selected with the `source` configuration. Additionally, the `monthPeriod` will be taken by default if the user does not choose the `default` option:

> ```yaml
> default:
>     period: { value: monthPeriod }
> ```

> The `filter_by_having` option used for the `cnt` and `value` columns is used to filter
> for entries that exactly have the value entered by the user. For the `closeDate` and
> `createdAt` columns, the user will be presented with a date widget which they can use to select
> an interval that reduces the set of entries being shown.

`options`

> Additional options that describe how the report will be presented. In the example above,
> reports will be exportable.

### Access the Report

To be able to access the new report, you can add a custom item to the *Reports & Segments* menu in
a configuration file named `navigation.yml` that is located in the `Resources/config` directory
of your bundle:

```yaml
navigation:
    menu_config:
        items:
            acme_demo_questions_report:
                label: acme.demo.question.entity_label
                route: acme_demo_question_report
                route_parameters:
                    reportGroupName: questions
                    reportName: question_report
            acme_demo_doctrine_type_field_list:
                label: acme.demo.doctrinetypefield.entity_plural_label
                route: acme_demo_doctrine_type_field_index
                extras:
                    routes:
                        - acme_demo_doctrine_type_field_index
                        - acme_demo_doctrine_type_field_view
            shortcut_acme_demo_doctrine_type_field_create:
```

The configuration of your new menu items is grouped under the `oro_menu_config` key. First, under the `items` key you create a new menu item which will be shown in the backend as *Accounts by Opportunity*. The report to be shown is selected by using the `reportGroupName` and `reportName` options in the `route_parameters` which refer to the report name as configured in [the example above](#book-reports-configuration). Of course, you can add additional items if you have more custom reports.

Then, under the `tree` key you add the newly created item to the *Reports & Segments* tab of the application menu.

## Segments

A segment is a representation of some dataset and is based on an entity and a set of filters. It is filtered data of the provided entity type.

There are two types of segments:

> 1. **Static** (is also called `On demand`)
> 2. **Dynamic**

The difference is that the dynamic segment displays real-time data, and the static segment has a set of snapshots. It filters data in the same way as the dynamic one and stores the state in a service table (oro_segment_snapshot). So, even if the data no longer corresponds to the filtering criteria in real-time, it will still exist in the dataset of the static segment. A static segment is a snapshot of the filtered data at some point in time.

> Also, both segment types have a table representation of data. It can be configured from the segment management pages.

<a id="backend-segments-frontend-implementation"></a>

### Frontend Implementation

A frontend part of the segment management is based on the *condition builder* that comes from *OroQueryDesignerBundle*. See the Condition Builder Component topic for more details. A **segmentation filter** roots from *AbstractFilter* of *OroFilterBundle* and provides the ajax-based autocomplete field, which, in turn, is based on the *JQuery.Select2* plugin.

<a id="backend-segments-backend-implementation"></a>

### Backend Implementation

#### Entities

**Segment** entity is descendant of the *AbstractQueryDesigner* model that comes from *OroQueryDesignerBundle*. This entity contains an entity name (based on), a JSON encoded definition, and service fields such as created/updated, owner, etc. **SegmentType** is a representation of possible segment types. The data fixture migration mechanism loads default types. **SegmentSnapshot** is a service entity. It contains snapshot data for **static** segments: a link to the segment to which it belongs, the *entityId* field linked to the entity of the type that the segment is based on, and the date of link creation.

#### Query Builders

As described before, **static** and **dynamic** segments have different ways of applying a filtering tool. There are two strategies, the *DynamicSegmentQueryBuilder* and *StaticSegmentQueryBuilder* correspondent.

#### Datagrid

For a table representation of the segment, use **OroDataGridBundle**. A grid configuration comes from the segment definition in *Oro\\Bundle\\SegmentBundle\\Grid\\ConfigurationProvider*. It retrieves the segment identifier from the grid name and passes the loaded segment entity to *SegmentDatagridConfigurationBuilder*. The datagrid configuration does not process filtering to encapsulate filtering logic in *SegmentFilter*. So, for those purposes, two proxy classes, *SegmentDatagridConfigurationQueryDesigner* and *DynamicSegmentQueryDesigner*, were created.

*SegmentDatagridConfigurationQueryDesigner* provides the definition to *segment filter* only. So, the datagrid configuration builder receives the definition for segment filter.

*DynamicSegmentQueryDesigner* is used by *SegmentQueryConverter* to decline converting definition of the columns, as the query builder needs only one field in the *SELECT* statement, which is an entity identifier.

<a id="backend-segments-usage"></a>

### Usage Examples

The query is retrieved using the following code:

```php
if ($segment->getType()->getName() === SegmentType::TYPE_DYNAMIC) {
    $query = $this->dynamicSegmentQueryBuilder->build($segment);
} else {
    $query = $this->staticSegmentQueryBuilder->build($segment);
}
```

A $query variable contains instance of  *\\Doctrine\\ORM\\Query*. Add it to the statement of any doctrine query in the following way:

```php
/** @var EntityManger $em */
$classMetadata = $em->getClassMetadata($segment->getEntity());
$identifiers   = $classMetadata->getIdentifier();

// SOME QUERY HERE
$qb = $em->createQueryBuilder()->select()
    ->from($segment->getEntity());

$alias = 'u';
// only not composite identifiers are supported
$identifier = sprintf('%s.%s', $alias, reset($identifiers));
$expr       = $qb->expr()->in($identifier, $query->getDQL());

$qb->where($expr);

$params = $query->getParameters();
/** @var Parameter $param */
foreach ($params as $param) {
    $qb->setParameter($param->getName(), $param->getValue(), $param->getType());
}
```
