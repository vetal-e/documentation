# Dashboards

## Create a Dashboard Widget

To display a list of tasks on the dashboard with the most recent tasks:

1. [Create a data grid](#cookbook-entities-dashboard-grid) that collects and displays the tasksâ€™ data while ensuring that the most recent tasks are displayed on top.
2. [Create a Twig template](#cookbook-entities-dashboard-template) that renders the grid.
3. [Configure](#cookbook-entities-dashboard-config) the dashboard widget by telling it which template to render.

### Configuring the Grid

The data grid that will be displayed on the dashboard can be based on the already existing `app-tasks-grid` that you used to show a grid of all the tasks being present. Sort the result (the id can be used as a sorting criterion as more recent tasks will have higher ids):

#### NOTE
src/Acme/Bundle/DemoBundle/Resources/config/oro/datagrids.yml
```yaml
 datagrids:
     # ...
     app-recent-tasks-grid:
         extends: app-tasks-grid
         sorters:
             default:
                 id: DESC
```

<a id="cookbook-entities-dashboard-template"></a>

### Widget Template

To render the data grid on the dashboard,  create a Twig template based on the `@OroDashboard/Dashboard/widget.html.twig` template. You will need to create a template called `recent_tasks_widget.html.twig` located in the `Resources/views/Dashboard` directory of you bundle (see [Adding Widget Configuration](#cookbook-entities-dashboard-config) for an explanation of the schema to follow for the template name and location) with the following content:

```html+jinja
 {% extends '@OroDashboard/Dashboard/widget.html.twig' %}
 {% import '@OroDataGrid/macros.html.twig' as dataGrid %}

 {% block content %}
     {{ dataGrid.renderGrid('app-recent-tasks-grid') }}
 {% endblock %}

 {% block actions %}
     {% set actions = [{
         'url': path('app_task_index'),
         'type': 'link',
         'label': 'All tasks',
     }] %}

     {{ parent() }}
 {% endblock %}
```

<a id="cookbook-entities-dashboard-config"></a>

### Adding Widget Configuration

```yaml
 dashboards:
     widgets:
         recent_tasks:
             label: Recent Tasks
             route: oro_dashboard_widget
             route_parameters:
                 bundle: AcmeDemo
                 name: recent_tasks_widget
             description: This widget displays the most recent tasks
```

The configured `oro_dashboard_widget` route refers to a controller action that comes as part of the `Oro\Bundle\DashboardBundle\Controller\DashboardController` and renders a template whose name is inferred from route parameters (the name of the template that the controller is looking for follows the `{{bundle}}:Dashboard:{{name}}` pattern where `{{bundle}}` and `{{name}}` refer to the route parameters of the dashboard config).

#### NOTE
If your widget contains some more logic (e.g., calling some service and doing something with its result), you can create your own controller, configure a route for it, and then refer to this route with the route key in your widget configuration.

### Adding New Dashboard Type

By default, each dashboard consists of a set of widgets, but there are cases when the dashboard should not be built from widgets. For example, when you want to use a third-party page as the dashboard for your application.

To add a new dashboard type, register a new dashboard type and add a fixture that will add the new dashboard type to the list
of available dashboard types.

To register a new dashboard type, add a new config provider that implements the DashboardTypeConfigProviderInterface interface:

```php
namespace Acme\DemoBundle\DashboardType;

use Oro\Bundle\DashboardBundle\DashboardType\DashboardTypeConfigProviderInterface;
use Oro\Bundle\DashboardBundle\Entity\Dashboard;

/**
 * Defines my dashboard type.
 */
class MyDashboardTypeConfigProvider implements DashboardTypeConfigProviderInterface
{
    public const TYPE_NAME = 'my_type';

    #[\Override]
    public function isSupported(?string $dashboardType): bool
    {
        return self::TYPE_NAME === $dashboardType;
    }

    #[\Override]
    public function getConfig(Dashboard $dashboard): array
    {
        return ['twig' => '@AcmeDemo/Index/default.html.twig'];
    }
}
```

In the example above, we added a provider that will return the `@AcmeDemo/Index/default.html.twig` twig template as the dashboard page.

Next, register this provider with the `oro_dashboard.dashboard_type.config.provider` tag:

```yaml
 acme_demo.dashboard_type.config.provider.my_dashboard:
     class: Acme\DemoBundle\DashboardType\MyDashboardTypeConfigProvider
     tags:
         - { name: oro_dashboard.dashboard_type.config.provider }
```

The final step is the fixture that extends `AbstractDashboardTypeFixture`. It adds the `my_type` dashboard type to the list of dashboard types:

```php
namespace Acme\DemoBundle\Migrations\Data\ORM;

use Oro\Bundle\DashboardBundle\Migrations\Data\ORM\AbstractDashboardTypeFixture;

/**
 * Adds my_type dashboard type to the list of available dashboard types.
 */
class AddMyDashboardTypeFixture extends AbstractDashboardTypeFixture
{
    #[\Override]
    protected function getDashboardTypeIdentifier(): string
    {
        return 'my_type';
    }

    #[\Override]
    protected function getDashboardTypeLabel(): string
    {
        return 'My type';
    }
}
```

After updating the platform, the `my_type` dashboard type with the label `My type` is displayed in the select box when creating a new dashboard page via the UI.
